# Discord Cleanup/Nitro Removal

Discord kept adding too much crap cluttering the interface, so it was time to set things right again. I don't know what I'm doing but I found others who had achieved what I was looking for, and built upon those as things kept changing. It's now too big to store in a discord post, so it can live here instead where it's more readable.

# Usage

Open up the console, paste, Enter, et voila! You may need to enable the inspector first.
